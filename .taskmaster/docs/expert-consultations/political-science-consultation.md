## 2. Core Findings: AI Governance and International Relations

### 2.1 Multi-Polar AI Governance Architecture

> **Core Finding (Dafoe, 2024):** "AI governance is emerging not as a single global regime but as a complex multi-layered system involving state, corporate, and civil society actors across multiple forums."

**Key Governance Layers:**
1. **Bilateral Frameworks:** US-China AI dialogue, EU-US AI cooperation agreements
2. **Multilateral Organizations:** UN AI Advisory Body, OECD AI Principles, UNESCO AI Ethics
3. **Regional Blocs:** EU AI Act, ASEAN AI governance framework, AU AI strategy
4. **Sectoral Regimes:** Military AI governance (LAWS), financial AI regulation, healthcare AI standards
5. **Multi-stakeholder Initiatives:** Partnership on AI, Global Partnership on AI (GPAI)

**Implementation for The Narrow Path:**
- Present governance as fragmented ecosystem rather than unified system
- Show competing frameworks creating coordination challenges
- Include corporate actors as quasi-sovereign entities in governance
- Demonstrate how different forums produce conflicting norms and standards

### 2.2 Digital Sovereignty vs Global Interdependence

> **Core Finding (Ding, 2024):** "The AI ecosystem creates dual dynamics of states pursuing sovereignty over AI infrastructures while establishing sovereign competence through AI infrastructures."

**Digital Sovereignty Strategies:**
- **Data Sovereignty:** Control over national data assets and cross-border data flows
- **Technological Sovereignty:** Domestic AI capabilities, chip manufacturing, talent retention
- **Regulatory Sovereignty:** Setting AI standards that become global norms (Brussels Effect)
- **Economic Sovereignty:** Protecting domestic AI markets, preventing foreign dependency

**Interdependence Realities:**
- Global supply chains for AI hardware (chips, rare earth metals)
- International talent mobility in AI research and development
- Cross-border data flows essential for AI training and deployment
- Shared need for AI safety research and standards

### 2.3 AI and Changing Power Dynamics

> **Core Finding (Kurbalija, 2024):** "Big Tech Companies have become de facto new geopolitical actors, requiring states to develop 'techplomacy' as foreign policy instrument."

**Power Redistribution Patterns:**
- **Corporate Power:** Tech companies with GDP-level resources and global influence
- **Network Effects:** Platform dominance creating new forms of structural power
- **Information Control:** AI systems shape discourse, perception, and social reality
- **Infrastructure Dependency:** National security dependent on private AI platforms

**State Responses:**
- Tech Ambassador appointments (Denmark, France, Germany, Switzerland, Estonia)
- Tech embassies in Silicon Valley and other innovation hubs
- Regulatory assertion (EU AI Act, China AI Law, US executive orders)
- Strategic partnerships between governments and tech companies

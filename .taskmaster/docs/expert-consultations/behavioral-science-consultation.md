## 2. Key Behavioral Science Findings for AI Risk Assessment

### 2.1 Cognitive Biases in AI Risk Perception

> **Core Finding (He et al., 2025):** "Six of eight cognitive biases were extensively observed across LLMs, with personality traits playing crucial roles in either amplifying or reducing biases."

**Primary Biases Affecting AI Risk Assessment:**
- **Anchoring Bias:** Users heavily weight initial risk assessments, even when new information emerges
- **Availability Heuristic:** Recent AI incidents disproportionately influence risk perception
- **Overconfidence Effect:** Tendency to overestimate accuracy of AI risk predictions
- **Base Rate Neglect:** Ignoring statistical baselines when assessing specific AI scenarios
- **Framing Effects:** Risk presentation significantly influences user perception and decisions

**Implementation for The Narrow Path:**
- Present P(doom) estimates with explicit uncertainty ranges
- Include multiple reference points to counter anchoring
- Frame risks in both frequency and probability formats
- Provide historical context to combat availability bias

### 2.2 Trust and Reliance Dynamics

> **Core Finding (Küper et al., 2025):** "Self-reported trust significantly predicted reliance behavior, explaining up to 24.1% of variance. Proper trust calibration involves relying on AI advice when accurate while trusting personal judgment when AI is likely incorrect."

**Trust Calibration Framework:**
- **Relative AI Reliance (RAIR):** Proportion of cases where humans correctly adjust incorrect opinions to follow accurate AI advice
- **Relative Self-Reliance (RSR):** Cases where individuals correctly rely on own judgment when AI advice is incorrect
- **Optimal Balance:** High RAIR and high RSR indicate properly calibrated trust

**Design Implications:**
- Provide clear indicators of AI confidence levels
- Show track record of AI accuracy across different scenario types
- Enable users to understand when to trust vs. question AI assessments
- Implement feedback loops showing decision outcomes over time

### 2.3 Reasoning Under Uncertainty (RUU) Challenges

> **Core Finding (Pilditch, 2024):** "RUU assistance creates multiplicative rather than additive risks due to structural interconnections with shifting incentives, limited transparency, and feedback loops."

**Key Challenges in AI Risk Scenarios:**
1. **Computational Explosiveness:** Uncertainty compounds exponentially in complex scenarios
2. **Deep Uncertainty:** Fundamental limits to prediction accuracy in novel AI developments
3. **Overreliance Risk:** Users may delegate critical thinking to AI systems
4. **Feedback Loop Delays:** Long-term consequences obscure immediate decision quality

**Mitigation Strategies:**
- Explicitly communicate uncertainty ranges and confidence intervals
- Require users to articulate reasoning before showing AI recommendations
- Provide scenario stress-testing capabilities
- Include explicit "uncertainty acknowledgment" steps in decision processes

### 2.4 Personality Factors in Risk Assessment

> **Core Finding (He et al., 2025):** "Personality traits significantly influence bias manifestation, with Conscientiousness and Agreeableness enhancing efficacy of bias mitigation strategies."

**Big Five Personality Impacts on AI Risk Perception:**

**Conscientiousness (High):**
- More deliberate decision-making processes

- *Design Response:* Provide detailed analytical tools and step-by-step reasoning frameworks

**Neuroticism (High):**
- Heightened loss aversion and risk sensitivity
- Greater susceptibility to anxiety-inducing scenarios
- Tendency toward worst-case thinking
- *Design Response:* Balance alarming scenarios with constructive action options

**Openness to Experience (High):**

- Enhanced creativity in solution generation
- Reduced anchoring to initial risk estimates
- *Design Response:* Include speculative and emerging risk scenarios

**Agreeableness (High):**
- More receptive to expert consensus views

- Potential over-deference to authority figures
- *Design Response:* Present diverse expert perspectives and encourage independent thinking

**Extraversion (High):**
- Tendency toward optimism bias in risk assessment
- Focus on potential gains over potential losses
- Social influence susceptibility
- *Design Response:* Emphasize base rates and provide sobering reference scenarios

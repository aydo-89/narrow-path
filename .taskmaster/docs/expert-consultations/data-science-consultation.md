## 3. Machine Learning Applications for Educational Games

### Player Segmentation and Clustering

**Temporal Clustering Approach:**
```python
# Time Series K-means for engagement pattern analysis
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import numpy as np

# Player engagement time series features
features = [
    'session_frequency',      # How often they play
    'depth_per_session',      # How deep they go in scenarios
    'reflection_quality',     # Quality of written reflections
    'community_engagement',   # Discussion participation
    'knowledge_retention'     # Learning assessment scores
]

# Five primary user segments identified:
# 1. Highly Active Learners (deep engagement, high retention)
# 2. Casual Explorers (regular but surface-level engagement)
# 3. Social Learners (community-focused, collaborative)
# 4. Intensive Episodic (concentrated bursts of activity)
# 5. Struggling Participants (low completion, need support)
```

**Graph-Based Behavioral Analysis:**

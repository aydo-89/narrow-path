    private baseProvider: ethers.Provider;
    private skaleProvider: ethers.Provider;
    
    constructor() {
        // Initialize connections to multiple Layer 2 networks
        this.polygonProvider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(POLYGON_RPC);
        this.baseProvider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(BASE_RPC);
        this.skaleProvider = new ethers.JsonRpcProvider(SKALE_RPC);
    }
    
    async issueAchievement(learnerAddress: string, achievementData: AchievementData) {
        // Use Polygon for immutable credential storage
        return await this.deployToPolygon(achievementData);
    }
    
    async processPayment(amount: number, currency: string) {
        // Use Base for fiat-crypto payment processing
        return await this.processOnBase(amount, currency);
    }
    
    async recordInteraction(interactionData: InteractionData) {
        // Use SKALE for high-frequency, zero-cost interactions
        return await this.logToSkale(interactionData);
    }
}
```

### Privacy-First Educational Blockchain Design

**Zero-Knowledge Educational Records:**
- **Challenge:** Protecting student privacy while enabling verification
- **Solution:** ZK-proofs for educational achievements without revealing personal data
- **Implementation:** Prove "completed AI safety course" without revealing identity or scores
- **Benefits:** GDPR compliance, student privacy protection, selective disclosure

**Decentralized Identity Integration:**
```solidity
contract PrivateEducationalRecord {
    using ZKVerifier for bytes32;
    
    struct PrivateAchievement {
        bytes32 credentialHash;    // Hashed credential data
        bytes32 zkProof;          // Zero-knowledge proof
        uint256 timestamp;        // Achievement date
        bool isValid;            // Verification status
    }
    
    mapping(address => PrivateAchievement[]) private records;
    
    function submitPrivateCredential(
        bytes32 credentialHash,
        bytes32 zkProof
    ) external {
        // Student submits achievement without revealing details
        // Employer can verify qualification without seeing grades/identity
        require(zkProof.verifyEducationalCompletion(credentialHash), "Invalid proof");
        
        records[msg.sender].push(PrivateAchievement({
            credentialHash: credentialHash,
            zkProof: zkProof,
            timestamp: block.timestamp,
            isValid: true
        }));
    }
    
    function verifyQualification(
        address candidate,
        string memory requiredSkill
    ) external view returns (bool qualified) {
        // Employers verify AI safety knowledge without privacy invasion
        // Returns only qualified/not qualified, no personal details
    }
}
```

## 4. Educational Token Economics Design

### Sustainable Learning Incentive Model

**Multi-Token Educational Economy:**
```solidity
contract EducationalTokenEconomics {
    // Three-token system for balanced incentives
    
    ERC20 public LEARN;    // Earned through learning activities
    ERC20 public TEACH;    // Earned through helping others learn
    ERC20 public GOVERN;   // Earned through community governance
    
    struct LearnerProfile {
        uint256 knowledgeLevel;      // 0-100 skill rating
        uint256 teachingReputation;  // Peer-validated teaching quality
        uint256 communityContrib;    // Governance participation
        uint256 lastActiveDate;     // Prevent token hoarding
    }
    
    function earnLearningTokens(
        address learner,
        string memory completedModule,
        uint8 assessmentScore
    ) external onlyEducationalContract {
        // Higher scores and difficult modules earn more tokens
        // Diminishing returns prevent gaming the system
        uint256 baseReward = 100;
        uint256 difficultyMultiplier = getModuleDifficulty(completedModule);
        uint256 scoreBonus = (assessmentScore * 50) / 100;
        
        uint256 reward = baseReward * difficultyMultiplier + scoreBonus;
        LEARN.mint(learner, reward);
    }
    
    function earnTeachingTokens(
        address teacher,
        address student,
        uint8 helpfulnessRating
    ) external {
        // Students rate the quality of peer teaching
        // Prevents sybil attacks through reputation weighting
        require(helpfulnessRating >= 7, "Minimum quality threshold");
        
        uint256 reward = helpfulnessRating * 10; // 70-100 TEACH tokens
        TEACH.mint(teacher, reward);
    }
}
```

**Token Utility and Redemption:**
- **LEARN Tokens:** Access to advanced scenarios, expert consultations, certificates
- **TEACH Tokens:** Recognition privileges, mentorship roles, content creation rights  
- **GOVERN Tokens:** Voting power in educational content decisions, platform direction
- **Cross-Token Synergies:** Holding all three token types unlocks special privileges

### Anti-Gaming Mechanisms

**Preventing Educational Token Abuse:**
```solidity
contract AntiGamingMeasures {
    uint256 public constant DAILY_LEARN_LIMIT = 500;  // Prevent credential mills
    uint256 public constant TEACHING_COOLDOWN = 1 hours;  // Limit rapid teaching claims
    
    mapping(address => uint256) public dailyLearningTokens;
    mapping(address => uint256) public lastTeachingTime;
    mapping(address => mapping(address => bool)) public hasHelped;
    
    modifier rateLimited() {
        require(
            dailyLearningTokens[msg.sender] < DAILY_LEARN_LIMIT,
            "Daily learning limit reached"
        );
        require(
            block.timestamp > lastTeachingTime[msg.sender] + TEACHING_COOLDOWN,
            "Teaching cooldown active"
        );
        _;
    }
    
    modifier uniqueHelp(address student) {
        require(
            !hasHelped[msg.sender][student],
            "Cannot repeatedly help same student"
        );
        _;
    }
    
    function validateLearningQuality(
        address learner,
        string memory evidence
    ) external view returns (bool) {
        // AI-powered analysis of learning evidence quality
        // Integration with educational assessment systems
        // Prevent copy-paste answers and superficial engagement
    }
}
```

## 5. Technical Implementation Strategy

### Hybrid Web2-Web3 Educational Architecture

**Progressive Web3 Adoption:**
```typescript
class HybridEducationalPlatform {
    private web3Enabled: boolean = false;
    private userProfile: UserProfile;
    
    constructor(user: UserProfile) {
        this.userProfile = user;
        this.web3Enabled = this.detectWeb3Capability();
    }
    
    async completeScenario(scenarioId: string, responses: Response[]) {
        // Core educational functionality works without Web3
        const completionData = await this.processLearning(scenarioId, responses);
        
        if (this.web3Enabled && this.userProfile.optedIntoWeb3) {
            // Optional blockchain features for willing users
            await this.recordOnChain(completionData);
            await this.issueTokenRewards(completionData.score);
            await this.updateDecentralizedCredentials(completionData);
        } else {
            // Traditional database storage for Web2 users
            await this.saveToDatabase(completionData);
        }
        
        return completionData;
    }
    
    private async detectWeb3Capability(): Promise<boolean> {
        // Graceful detection without forcing Web3 adoption
        return typeof window.ethereum !== 'undefined';
    }
}
```

**User-Friendly Onboarding:**
- **Web3 Optional:** Full educational experience available without cryptocurrency
- **Gradual Introduction:** Introduce blockchain benefits after user engagement
- **Social Recovery:** Help users recover access through community attestation
- **Gas Abstraction:** Platform covers transaction costs for educational interactions

### Cross-Chain Educational Infrastructure

**Multi-Chain Achievement Synchronization:**
```solidity
// Cross-chain bridge for educational credentials
contract EducationalBridge {
    mapping(uint256 => ChainData) public supportedChains;
    mapping(bytes32 => bool) public processedTransfers;
    
    struct ChainData {
        string name;              // "Polygon", "Base", "SKALE"
        address credentialContract; // Contract address on that chain
        bool isActive;           // Currently supported
    }
    
    event CredentialBridged(
        address indexed learner,
        uint256 fromChain,
        uint256 toChain,
        bytes32 indexed credentialHash
    );
    
    function bridgeCredential(
        uint256 destinationChain,
        bytes32 credentialHash,
        bytes memory proof
    ) external {
        // Allow learners to move credentials between chains
        // Maintain consistency across educational platforms
        // Enable employer verification on any supported chain
        
        require(supportedChains[destinationChain].isActive, "Chain not supported");
        require(!processedTransfers[credentialHash], "Already processed");
        
        // Verify credential authenticity on source chain
        require(verifyCredentialProof(credentialHash, proof), "Invalid credential");
        
        // Record bridge transaction
        processedTransfers[credentialHash] = true;
        
        // Emit event for destination chain processing
        emit CredentialBridged(msg.sender, block.chainid, destinationChain, credentialHash);
    }
}
```

## 6. Educational Blockchain Ethics Framework

### Avoiding Web3 Dark Patterns in Education

**Ethical Token Design Principles:**
1. **Educational Value First:** Tokens enhance learning rather than replacing it
2. **No Pay-to-Win:** Core educational outcomes accessible regardless of token holdings
3. **Transparent Economics:** Clear explanation of all token mechanics and their purpose
4. **Sustainable Incentives:** Reward genuine learning over token speculation
5. **Community Governance:** Democratic control over educational content and priorities

**Anti-Speculation Measures:**
```solidity
contract AntiSpeculationEducation {
    uint256 public constant LEARNING_LOCKUP = 30 days;  // Prevent immediate token sales
    uint256 public constant MAX_TRADE_PERCENTAGE = 10;  // Limit daily trading volume
    
    mapping(address => uint256) public earnedTokens;
    mapping(address => uint256) public purchasedTokens;
    mapping(address => uint256) public lastEarnDate;
    
    modifier learningLockup() {
        require(
            block.timestamp > lastEarnDate[msg.sender] + LEARNING_LOCKUP,
            "Recently earned tokens locked"
        );
        _;
    }
    
    function sellLearningTokens(uint256 amount) external learningLockup {
        // Prioritize learning over speculation
        // Encourage long-term educational engagement
        require(
            amount <= earnedTokens[msg.sender] * MAX_TRADE_PERCENTAGE / 100,
            "Excessive selling of learning tokens"
        );
        
        // Implementation continues...
    }
}
```

### Environmental Sustainability

**Carbon-Neutral Educational Blockchain:**
- **Layer 2 Selection:** Choose environmentally friendly blockchains (Polygon, Base)
- **Proof-of-Stake:** Avoid energy-intensive Proof-of-Work systems
- **Carbon Offsetting:** Automatic carbon credit purchases for platform operations
- **Green Hosting:** Renewable energy for educational infrastructure

**Sustainable Computing Incentives:**
```solidity
contract SustainableEducation {
    uint256 public carbonCreditPerToken = 0.001 ether; // 0.1% of tokens buy carbon credits
    address public carbonCreditProvider;
    
    mapping(address => uint256) public greenContributions;
    
    function mintWithCarbonOffset(address learner, uint256 amount) external {
        // Mint educational tokens
        _mint(learner, amount);
        
        // Automatically purchase carbon offsets
        uint256 offsetCost = (amount * carbonCreditPerToken) / 1000;
        if (offsetCost > 0) {
            _purchaseCarbonCredits(offsetCost);
            greenContributions[learner] += offsetCost;
        }
    }
    
    function _purchaseCarbonCredits(uint256 amount) private {
        // Integration with verified carbon credit providers
        // Ensure educational blockchain operations are carbon-negative
    }

Uses vertical fill gauge instead of clock metaphor\n  - Clear P(doom) percentage display with proper notation\n  - Risk zones: Safe, Caution, Danger, Critical\n  - Animated particles and pulsing effects\n\n## UI Components\n- LoadingScreen: Elegant loading with progress bar\n- ScenarioViewer: Decision interface with 4-choice selection\n- GameUI: Glass morphism overlay with top bar and action panels\n\n## Styling System\n- GlobalStyles: Elegant Apocalypse theme implementation\n- Theme: Comprehensive color palette and design tokens\n- Mobile-responsive design patterns\n\n## Key Design Decisions\n- Changed from \"P(Doom) Clock\" to \"P(doom) Gauge\" \n  - Fixes notation and eliminates confusion\n  - Uses intuitive vertical fill meter\n- Glass morphism UI design for sophisticated look\n- Mobile-first responsive approach\n\nAll core frontend infrastructure is in place and ready for testing.\n</info added on 2025-06-30T15:20:01.435Z>\n<info added on 2025-06-30T15:24:03.052Z>\n# Architectural Breakthrough: Dual-Axis Risk System\n\n## Core Game Mechanic Redesign\n- Replaced single P(doom) gauge with dual-axis \"Narrow Path\" system\n- Implemented Tristan Harris concept of navigating between two extremes\n- Created mathematical model for balancing between chaos and control\n\n## New Lose Conditions\n- **P(doom) ≥ 100%**: CHAOS/DOOM scenario (uncontrolled decentralized AI)\n- **Dystopia Level ≥ 100%**: DYSTOPIA/CONTROL scenario (surveillance state)\n- Player must navigate the \"Narrow Path\" between these extremes\n\n## Visual Implementation\n- Developed NarrowPathVisualization component replacing PDoomGauge\n- Designed intuitive visual system:\n  - Left side: Red gradient (Chaos/Doom risk)\n  - Right side: Blue gradient (Dystopia/Control risk)\n  - Center: Green zone (safe \"Narrow Path\")\n  - Dynamic player position indicator\n  - Animated risk bars for both dimensions\n  - Distinct game over states for both failure modes\n\n## Decision System Updates\n- Enhanced ScenarioViewer to track 3 dimensions:\n  - pDoom: Chaos/decentralization risk\n  - dystopia: Authoritarian control risk\n  -
